# User Management Microservice

REST API for user management microservice with swagger UI available on 
# https://users.skycomposer.net/usermgmt/swagger-ui/index.html

# Microservices Deployment on EKS

## Step-00: What are Microservices?
- Understand what are microservices on  a very high level

## Step-01: What are we going to learn in this section?
- We are going to deploy two microservices.
    - User Management Service
    - Notification Service

### Usecase Description
- User Management **Create User API**  will call Notification service **Send Notification API** to send an email to user when we create a user. 


### List of Docker Images used in this section
| Application Name                 | Docker Image Name                          |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| User Management Microservice | stacksimplify/kube-usermanagement-microservice:1.0.0 |
| Notifications Microservice V1 | stacksimplify/kube-notifications-microservice:1.0.0 |
| Notifications Microservice V2 | stacksimplify/kube-notifications-microservice:2.0.0 |

## Step-02: Pre-requisite -1: AWS RDS Database, ALB Ingress Controller & External DNS

### AWS RDS Database
- We have created AWS RDS Database as part of section [06-EKS-Storage-with-RDS-Database](/06-EKS-Storage-with-RDS-Database/README.md)
- We even created a `externalName service: 01-MySQL-externalName-Service.yml` in our Kubernetes manifests to point to that RDS Database. 

### ALB Ingress Controller & External DNS
- We are going to deploy a application which will also have a `ALB Ingress Service` and also will register its DNS name in Route53 using `External DNS`
- Which means we should have both related pods running in our EKS cluster. 
- We have installed **ALB Ingress Controller** as part of section [08-01-ALB-Ingress-Install](/08-ELB-Application-LoadBalancers/08-01-ALB-Ingress-Install/README.md)
- We have installed **External DNS** as part of section [08-06-01-Deploy-ExternalDNS-on-EKS](/08-ELB-Application-LoadBalancers/08-06-ALB-Ingress-ExternalDNS/08-06-01-Deploy-ExternalDNS-on-EKS/README.md)
```
# Verify alb-ingress-controller pod running in namespace kube-system
kubectl get pods -n kube-system

# Verify external-dns pod running in default namespace
kubectl get pods
```


## Step-03: Pre-requisite-2: Create Simple Email Service - SES SMTP Credentials
### SMTP Credentials
- Go to Services -> Simple Email Service
- SMTP Settings --> Create My SMTP Credentials
- **IAM User Name:** append the default generated name with microservice or something so we have a reference of this IAM user created for our ECS Microservice deployment
- Download the credentials and update the same for below environment variables which you are going to provide in kubernetes manifest `04-NotificationMicroservice-Deployment.yml`
```
AWS_MAIL_SERVER_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
AWS_MAIL_SERVER_USERNAME=****
AWS_MAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=***
AWS_MAIL_SERVER_FROM_ADDRESS= use-a-valid-email@gmail.com 
```
- **Important Note:** Environment variable AWS_MAIL_SERVER_FROM_ADDRESS value should be a **valid** email address and also verified in SES. 

### Verfiy Email Addresses to which notifications we need to send.
- We need two email addresses for testing Notification Service.  
-  **Email Addresses**
    - Verify a New Email Address
    - Email Address Verification Request will be sent to that address, click on link to verify your email. 
    - **From Address:** stacksimplify@gmail.com (replace with your ids during verification)
    - **To Address:** dkalyanreddy@gmail.com (replace with your ids during verification)
- **Important Note:** We need to ensure all the emails (FromAddress email) and (ToAddress emails) to be verified here. 
    - Reference Link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html    
- Environment Variables
    - AWS_MAIL_SERVER_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    - AWS_MAIL_SERVER_USERNAME=*****
    - AWS_MAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=*****
    - AWS_MAIL_SERVER_FROM_ADDRESS=stacksimplify@gmail.com


## Step-04: Create Notification Microservice Deployment Manifest
- Update environment Variables for Notification Microservice
- **Notification Microservice Deployment**
```yml
          - name: AWS_MAIL_SERVER_HOST
            value: "smtp-service"
          - name: AWS_MAIL_SERVER_USERNAME
            value: "AKIABCDEDFASUBKLDOAX"
          - name: AWS_MAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD
            value: "Bdsdsadsd32qcsads65B4oLo7kMgmKZqhJtEipuE5unLx"
          - name: AWS_MAIL_SERVER_FROM_ADDRESS
            value: "stacksimplify@gmail.com"
```

## Step-05: Create Notification Microservice SMTP ExternalName Service
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: smtp-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

## Step-06: Create Notification Microservice NodePort Service
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: notification-clusterip-service
  labels:
    app: notification-restapp
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: notification-restapp
  ports:
  - port: 8096
    targetPort: 8096
```
## Step-07: Update User Management Microservice Deployment Manifest with Notification Service Environment Variables. 
- User Management Service new environment varibales related to Notification Microservice in addition to already which were configured related to MySQL
- Update in `02-UserManagementMicroservice-Deployment.yml`
```yml
          - name: NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_HOST
            value: "notification-clusterip-service"
          - name: NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_PORT
            value: "8096"    
```
## Step-08: Update ALB Ingress Service Kubernetes Manifest
- Update Ingress Service to ensure only target it is going to have is User Management Service
- Remove /app1, /app2 contexts
```yml
    # External DNS - For creating a Record Set in Route53
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: services.kubeoncloud.com, ums.kubeoncloud.com
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /* # SSL Redirect Setting
            backend:
              serviceName: ssl-redirect
              servicePort: use-annotation                   
          - path: /*
            backend:
              serviceName: usermgmt-restapp-nodeport-service
              servicePort: 8095              
```

## Step-09: Deploy Microservices manifests
```
# Deploy Microservices manifests
kubectl apply -f V1-Microservices/
```

## Step-10: Verify the Deployment using kubectl
```
# List Pods
kubectl get pods

# User Management Microservice Logs
kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get po | egrep -o 'usermgmt-microservice-[A-Za-z0-9-]+')

# Notification Microservice Logs
kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get po | egrep -o 'notification-microservice-[A-Za-z0-9-]+')

# External DNS Logs
kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get po | egrep -o 'external-dns-[A-Za-z0-9-]+')

# List Ingress
kubectl get ingress
```

## Step-11: Verify Microservices health-status via browser
```
# User Management Service Health-Status
https://services.kubeoncloud.com/usermgmt/health-status

# Notification Microservice Health-Status via User Management
https://services.kubeoncloud.com/usermgmt/notification-health-status
https://services.kubeoncloud.com/usermgmt/notification-service-info
```

## Step-12: Import postman project to Postman client on our desktop. 
- Import postman project
- Add environment url 
    - https://services.kubeoncloud.com (**Replace with your ALB DNS registered url on your environment**)

## Step-13: Test both Microservices using Postman
### User Management Service
- **Create User**
    - Verify the email id to confirm account creation email received.
- **List User**   
    - Verify if newly created user got listed. 
    


## Step-14: Rollout New Deployment - Set Image Option
```
# Rollout New Deployment using Set Image
kubectl set image deployment/notification-microservice notification-service=stacksimplify/kube-notifications-microservice:2.0.0 --record=true

# Verify Rollout Status
